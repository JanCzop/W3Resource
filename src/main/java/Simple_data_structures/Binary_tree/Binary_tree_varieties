Full binary tree = the tree with either 0 or 2 children in each node. So full binary tree does not have any
    node with one children.

    appliance:
    - Binary-Search-Tree (BST) with very efficient operations.
    - Black-Red and AVL trees -//-
    - File indexation
    - Huffman compression algorithm // TODO

Degenerated tree = the tree in which each node can only have one child.

    appliance:
    - easy transform to LinkedList
    - can represent sequences in databases relations

Skewed tree = the tree in which all nodes have only one or no child.

    appliance:
    - -//- LinkedList
    - some specific algorithms

Complete tree = the tree with completed (apart from last level) children, last nodes are turned left.

    appliance:
    - Binary heaps. Heapsort
    - Priority queues

Ideal tree = the tree with all children completed.

    appliance:
    - Best for searching O(log n)
    - Heaps
    - Graph algorithms.

Balanced tree = the tree with left and right subtrees difference maximum 1 in height.

    appliance:
    - AVL trees and Black-Red
    - indexing databases
    - Priority queues
