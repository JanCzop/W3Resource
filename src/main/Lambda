Java Lambda [25 exercises with solution]

[An editor is available at the bottom of the page to write and execute the scripts.  Go to the editor]

Java 8 introduces several new language features designed to make it easier to write such blocks of code-the key feature being lambda expressions, also colloquially referred to as closures or anonymous methods. A lambda expression is just a shorter way of writing an implementation of a method for later execution.
